# TodoApp

This is the first app made by me when i started to learn Vue.js using vuetify for UI compononets, Axios for http requests, Vuex for state management.

It provides ability to add new tasks, mark, delete and archive them.

It also provides a simple login to associate Task with a user. Multiple users can add tasks.

The App consists of 3 tabs:
1st Tab - To add notes
2nd Tab - To login/logout
3rd Tab - random Comic strip loading from an API
